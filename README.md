# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Project:

This project uses JavaScript and the D3.js library to retreive coordinates for earthquake GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used along with maps from the Mapbox API to create interactivity with the map and the earthquake visualizations.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to show visually the differences of magnitudes of earthquakes around the world in the last seven days in a Mapbox map and provide ways to interact with it.

## Results:

Throughout the project maps have been developed step by step to figure out how to use different features of the Leaflet library to procide interactivity with the Mapbox maps. The project starts from a simple map to adding multiple points, lines, popups, markers and layers. The final challenge results in an interactive map overlayed with earthquakes all over the world along with tectonic plate locations.

## Summary:

The project is a good source to learn and understand how to use the Leaflet library to add overlays to maps. The final product is a map full of earthquake locations and tectonic plate visuzlizations that can be removed and re-added to the map simply by clicking on toogles. There is also a legend that tells us what all the different colors in the earthquake visualzation stand for.
